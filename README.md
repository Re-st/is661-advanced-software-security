## Course Description

## Grading

## Textbook
- Lecture slides will be provided
- [Program Synthesis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/program_synthesis_now.pdf)
- [Introduction to Program Synthesis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/SynthesisCourse/index.htm)

## Homework
This course includes programming assignments through which students will learn how to design
and implement program analyzers.
Students will use a few tools which are described [here](TOOL.md).

All submissions will be managed using Github.
For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted in the [issue board](../../issues).
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
You can push as many commits as you want before the deadline. We will grade the final commit of your `master` branch.

The late homework policy is as follows:
- 80% credit for one day late
- 50% credit for two days late
- NO credit given after two days late
