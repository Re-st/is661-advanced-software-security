## Course Description
The goal of this course is to develop scientific communication skills.
Students will learn how to write a research paper, give a technical
talk, and review a research paper. Students will propose and complete
a research project during the semester.

## Grading
- Paper review: 40%
- Final project: 50%
- Participation: 10%

## Project Theme: Understandable & Explainable Programming Systems
Observation is the beginning of all sciences.
For example, Heliocentrism, one of the most important scientific discovery,
started from several critical observation by Galileo Galilei.
This observation led to the development of modern astronomy.
Computer science is no exception.
Only when we observe the behavior of large and complicated software systems,
we can understand how they work and discover new knowledge.

The project theme of this course is "Be Galileo of Programming Systems".
Students will make a visualization tool for understandable and explainable
programming systems (e.g., program analyzer, fuzzer, synthesizer, compiler, etc).
The visualization tool should help users understand the behavior of the
underlying programming system. For example, such tools can provide the following benefits:
- Help computer scientists (e.g., yourself) find new research problems in programming language, software engineering, or security.
- Help non-expert users understand the behavior of software analyzers.

Students can refer to the following projects for inspiration:
- [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov)
- [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org)
- [Fuzzle](https://softsec-kaist.github.io/Fuzzle/)
- [D3](https://d3js.org)

## Academic Integrity Violation
Students who violate academic integrity will get an F.
