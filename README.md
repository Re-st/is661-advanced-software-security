## Homework
This course includes programming assignments through which students will learn how to design
and implement program analyzers.
Students will use a few tools which are described [here](TOOL.md).

All submissions will be managed using Github.
For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted in the [issue board](../../issues).
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
